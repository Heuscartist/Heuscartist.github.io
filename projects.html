                    <h3>Mastering AI</h3>
                    <p>This repository is meant as a personal portfolio for the domain of AI/ML. I will be uploading my personal projects done in my free time or during my academic courses on this repository. These will include projects in the domain of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Generative AI. I am also planning on working on various other domains as well such as TinyML and Reinforcement learning.</p>

                    <h3>Gesture Recognition with TinyML</h3>
                    <p>In this project we will show you how to use accelerometer measurements in conjunction with Machine Learning (ML) to hand gestures with the Raspberry Pi Pico. These gestures can then be applied to perform any function of our choosing.</p>

                    <h3>Self-Driving Car Model</h3>
                    <p>In this project I aim to create a simple model of a self driving car that is capable of following lane markers, avoid collision and detect traffic signs for traffic flow control.
                        The model was built using ESP32-CAM and Arduino and made use of TinyML for object detection on Edge for identifying traffic signs.

                    <h3>FM Transmission SSB Modulation</h3>
                    <p>This repository is for the university course "Analog and Digital Communication" Complex Engineering Project of created an FM Transmission System using SSB-SC Modulation and an additive guassian noise channel. Following are the requirements of the project.</p>
